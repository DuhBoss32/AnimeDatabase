## Overview
The Anime Database Project aims to collect, store, analyze, and visualize data related to anime. It involves web scraping anime information from MyAnimeList, storing the data in a MySQL database, analyzing it, and creating visualizations to gain insights.

## Components

### 1. Web Scraping
The project starts by scraping anime data from MyAnimeList. This includes information such as title, rating, genres, synopsis, and URL. Beautiful Soup is used for web scraping.

### 2. MySQL Database
The scraped anime data is stored in a MySQL database. The database schema includes tables for storing anime information, user profiles, and personal ratings.

### 3. Frontend Visualization
A frontend interface is developed to showcase the anime database and user information. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are used for frontend development. The data fetched from the database is used to create interactive visualizations and displays.

## Project Workflow

1. **Web Scraping**: Anime data is scraped from MyAnimeList using Beautiful Soup.
2. **Data Storage**: The scraped data is stored in a MySQL database, including user profiles and personal ratings.
3. **Frontend Development**: A frontend interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize the anime data and user information.
4. **Visualization**: The fetched data is visualized using various visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
5. **Deployment**: The project can be deployed on a server for access by users.

## Technologies Used

- Python: For web scraping, data analysis, and backend development.
- Beautiful Soup: For web scraping anime data.
- MySQL: For storing the scraped anime data and user information.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For frontend development and visualization.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly: For data visualization.

## Future Improvements
